# Makefile --- A simple Makefile for working on specs.

# This is a generic Makefile for generating HTML documents from Bikeshed
# and Markdown source files.

# Bikeshed (.bs) is a popular format for writing specifications in. This
# Makefile assumes you have a local install of bikeshed. Installation
# instructions can be found here:
#
#     https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#installing

# Markdown (.md) is commonly used for README files, explainers, and
# other documentation adjacent to specifications. This Makefile assumes
# you have a local install of the Python markdown2 module. You can
# install it like any other Python module, with pip:
#
#     pip install markdown2

# This Makefile also runs make in any immediate subdirectories, because
# documentation or other auxilliary materials are often in
# subdirectories.

docs    = $(patsubst %.md,%.html,$(wildcard *.md))
specs   = $(patsubst %.bs,%.html,$(wildcard *.bs))
subdirs = $(shell find -L . -type d -depth 1 -not -name \.\*)

.PHONY: all docs specs subdirs clean $(subdirs)
.SUFFIXES: .bs .md .html

	rm -f $(docs) $(specs) *~

	bikeshed spec $< $@

.md.html:
	echo "<!doctype html>\n<meta charset=utf-8>\n" > $@
	markdown2 $< >> $@
